# SQL Projects

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that I worked on while studying the subject. The projects were developed using MySQL and SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), and cover a range of topics such as data modeling, query optimization, and database design.

Each project is organized in its own folder, and includes a README file with a brief description and instructions on how to run the project. Additionally, the SQL code is provided in separate files, making it easy to review and modify the code as needed.

Feel free to browse the projects and use them as a reference for your own SQL projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
